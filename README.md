# iban-validator

## Assignment

In the programming language of your choice, create a webserver that responds to a REST API call.
You should implement one endpoint, which validates if an [IBAN][1] number is valid or not.

Don't worry about making a perfect solution to this problem: no need to solve every corner case. We estimate that this should take you about 4 to 8 hours of programming time.
